# SourceCred Template Instance

This repository contains a template for running a SourceCred instance.

New users of SourceCred are encouraged to fork this repo to start their own
instance.

This repo comes with a GitHub action configured that will run SourceCred automatically
every 6 hours, as well as any time you change the configuration.

# About SourceCred Instances

SourceCred is organized around "instances". Every instance must have a
`sourcecred.json` file at root, which specifies which plugins are active in the
instance. Config and permanent data (e.g. the Ledger) are stored in the master branch.
All output or site data gets stored in the `gh-pages` branch by the Github Action.

Configuration files:
- `config/grain.json` specifies how much Grain to distribute every week. The `maxSimultaneousDistributions` parameter 
determines how many weeks of "back-distributions" to generate if the command hasn't been run in a while (or ever).
- `config/plugins/$PLUGIN_OWNER/$PLUGIN_NAME` stores plugin-specific data. Each
  plugin has its own directory. See the plugin section below to learn how to configure them.

Permanent Data:
- `data/ledger.json` keeps a history of all grain distributions and transfers as well as identities added / merged.

Generated Data: 

- `cache/` stores intermediate produced by the plugins. This directory should
  not be checked into Git at all.
- `output/` stores output data generated by SourceCred, including the Cred
  Graph and Cred Scores. This directory should be checked into Git; when
  needed, it may be removed and re-generated by SourceCred.
- `site/` which stores the compiled SourceCred frontend, which can display data
  stored in the instance.


# Setup and Usage

Using this instance as a starting point, you can update the config to include
just the plugins you want, pointing at the data you care about. We recommend setting up
your instance locally first and make sure its working before pushing your changes
to master and using the Github Action.

Get [Yarn] and then run `yarn` to install SourceCred and dependencies.

Update the configuration files according to the plugin guides below.

Then, run the following commands to update the instance:

- `yarn load [...plugins]` loads the cache. By default, it loads all
  plugins, or it can load only specific plugins if requested.
- `yarn graph  [...plugins]` regenerates plugin graphs from the cache;
  these graphs get saved in `output/`
- `yarn score` computes Cred scores, combining data from all the chosen
  plugins
- `yarn grain` distributes Grain according to the current Cred scores, and the config in `config/grain.json`

**Generate the frontend:**

- `yarn site`

**Run the frontend:**

- `yarn serve`


If you want to clear the cached data, you can do so via:

- `yarn clean` 

Running `yarn clean` is a good idea if any plugins fail to load.

If you want to restart from a clean slate and remove all the generated graphs, you can do so via:

- `yarn clean-all` 

Run `yarn clean-all` if the `yarn graph` command fails due to a change in the config or breaking changes in a new version of SourceCred.
**Warning**: If you don't have credentials for every plugin, you might not be able to regenerate parts of the graph.

### Publishing on GitHub pages

Once you've got the instance configured to your satisfaction (see instructions on plugins below),
commit and push your changes to master (or make a pull request). The Github Action will then generate the frontend
and deploy it to GitHub Pages. To enable GitHub Pages for your instance, check out [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).
Make sure you select `gh-pages` as the branch to publish from. 

# Supported Plugins

## GitHub

The GitHub plugin loads GitHub repositories.

You can specify the repositories to load in
`config/plugins/sourcecred/github/config.json`.

The Github Action automatically has its own GITHUB_TOKEN, but if you need to load data from the 
GitHub plugin locally, you must have a GitHub API key in your environment as
`$SOURCECRED_GITHUB_TOKEN`. The key should be read-only without any special
permissions (unless you are loading a private GitHub repository, in which case
the key needs access to your private repositories).

You can generate a GitHub API key [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

## Discourse

The Discourse plugin loads Discourse forums; currently, only one forum can be loaded in any single instance. This does not require any special API
keys or permissions. You just need to set the server url in `config/plugins/sourcecred/discourse/config.json`.

## Discord

The Discord plugin loads Discord servers, and mints cred on Discord reactions.

To get this setup, you'll first want to enable Developer Mode in your Discord
client, under User Settings -> Appearance -> Advanced -> Developer Mode. This
will give you the ability to right-click on items and copy their Discord ids.

Then, right click on the server you want to track, and copy its ID. Modify the
`config/plugins/sourcecred/discord/config.json` file to have the correct
guildId.

Next, you'll need to create a Discord application and add it to the server. (This requires admin permissions on that server.)

The first step is to create an application, which you can do here:
https://discordapp.com/developers/applications

You'll get an application client ID, which you'll need in a future step.

Next, give that application a Bot by clicking on the "Bot" menu option on the left, and then adding a bot.
The bot will have a token, which you should also save.

Once you've made the bot, you need to invite it to your server.
You'll need to do so by constructing a URL like:

`https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&scope=bot&permissions=8

Where `${CLIENT_ID}` should be replaced with your application's client id from
above. For example, if your application's client id is 1234, use the following url:

`https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1234&scope=bot&permissions=8`

Open that url in a browser where you are logged into Discord, and you'll see a
menu letting you add the bot to servers you have access to. Add it to the
server in question, giving it permission to read messages and read message
history.

You need to add this token into GitHub for the Action to work correctly.
[Checkout this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) 
to see how you can add the token as a Secret that can be read by the Action. Set the name to `SOURCECRED_DISCORD_TOKEN`;

If you are running SourceCred locally, set the bot token to the environment variable `$SOURCECRED_DISCORD_TOKEN`.

You can now load your Discord server. Hooray!

As an added bit of configuration, you can set custom reactionWeights in the
`reactionWeights` section of the Discord config. These allow you to change how
much Cred is minted per reaction.

If you want to change the weight for a default reaction, just put the
reaction's literal emoji in the config.json, as in `"ðŸ’œ": 5` to give the purple
heart a weight of 5.

If you want to set a custom weight for a custom emoji, you'll need to get the
custom emoji's server id. You can do this by right-clicking on a custom emoji
in the server, and clicking "copy link". This will give you a link to the
emoji's image on Discord's servers, for example:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/678399364418502669.png?v=1

The numeric substring is the emoji's ID. You can then specify it in the
reaction weights file as `$EMOJI_NAME:$EMOJI_ID`, as in:
`"sourcecred:678399364418502669": 10` to give some server's custom SourceCred
emoji a weight of 10.

# Removing plugins

To deactivate a plugin, just remove it from the `bundledPlugins` array in the `sourcecred.json` file.
You can also remove its `config/plugins/OWNER/NAME` directory for good measure.
